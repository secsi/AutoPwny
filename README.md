## About The Project

Check the blog post at Badoosb.com for full details. The method is effectively using caps, num and scroll lock keys to allow this Adafruit Feather to operate as a keyboard, yet still determine outputs of commands injected.

Effectively a BadUSB with the ability to react to outputs.

Shouts to Pablo for the Logo, and Sina for spurring me on.
